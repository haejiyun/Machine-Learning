**[SQL] Creation of Housing Database and Querie**

<ins>Presentation :<ins/>

Creation of SQL database based on UML diagram and SQL queries. The dataset contains 34,169 records on real estate sales in France with its information such as size, price, address, rooms, etc. Demographic dataset downloaded from INSEE was combined to it in order to add regional information. Multiple queries were executed to analyse regional real estate market.


[Analysis] Panorama of Food Security
----------
Code :

Presentation :

Food security analysis with python by combining datasets of food aids, food availabity, population, malnutrition, food energy need from FAO. In order to understand food security status of 2017 on earth, world food availability, possible number of people the world can feed, usage of food, food aids distribution etc. were analysed and visualised.


[Database] E-commerce Product Database
----------
Code :

Presentation :

E-commerce product data management with 825 products listed on ERP and 714 products listed on e-shop. Web generated information required data cleaning and data processing in order to bring it together with ERP generated product information. Sales and outlier prices were analysed to ensure data quality.


[Analysis] E-commerce sales and customer profile
----------
Code :

Presentation :

Two years e-commerce salses analysis from datasets of customers, product, and sales. Multiple data cleaning was required to analyse yearly sales, sales evolution through time, sales per category and customer profile. Different test statistics and visualisation were usded to study relations between variables.

[Knime] Gender Equality Indicator Workflow
----------
Workflow :

Presentation :

Creation of workflow generating graphics showing gender equality within a company. The workflow is created from three datasets of employee, salary, and job information. Different graphics are generated from the workflow and the combinasion of datasets created a downloadable table to be used in Tableau for dashboard.


[Tableau] Drinking Water Dashboard
----------
Dashboard :

Creation do dashboard presenting drinking water situation in the world. Datasets related to country, political stability, mortality in relation with water, population, and drinking water were used to visualize differents safe water indicators.


[Clustering] Country Food Market
----------
Code :

Presentation :

Country group analysis by clustering. Country groups were made based on information collected from datasets of population and food availability from FAO. Two methods of clustering are used and visualised to compare the results.


[Machine Learning] Fake Bill Detection
----------
Code :

Presentation :

Modelling automatic fake bill detection. Le dataset containing geometric information of 1,500 bills is used for modelling. Two algorithms are tested to select the best performing one.
