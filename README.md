# Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository showcases a collection of my academic machine learning projects. The projects cover a range of techniques, from sentiment analysis using natural language processing to supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms for classification and clustering tasks. Each project demonstrates my ability to apply appropriate machine learning methods to real-world problems and communicate the insights through interactive applications and presentations.

Code : [Click here](https://github.com/haejiyun/Machine-Learning/blob/main/NLP/projet_marketing.py)<br/>
Streamlit Repo : [Click here](https://github.com/haejiyun/airbnb-reviews)<br/>
The purpose of this project is to analyze Airbnb guest experiences in Paris across various time periods, leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on guest reviews. By combining various NLP tasks, this study aims to provide meaningful insights and a holistic view of guest experiences. The analysis results were transformed into an interactive Streamlit application.

- **[Python] Classification with Machine Learning Algorithms**<br/>
Project : [Click here](https://github.com/haejiyun/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning/supervised_learning.pdf)<br/>
Classification of simulated socio-economic classes based on socio-demographic and economical data published by INSEE. The project treated imbalanced data.
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM algorithms were trainend by cross-validation method selectiong best performing algorithms based on confusion matrix, ROC and AUC.
<br/>

- **[Python] Clustering - Dimensionality Reduction - Rupture detection**<br/>
Project : [Click here](https://github.com/haejiyun/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Unsupervised%20Learning/Unsupervised_Learning_Haeji_YUN.pdf)<br/>
Unsupervised machine learning study applied on the socio-economic and political database used in the book “Une histoire du conflit politique” to analyse characteristics of french communes over the years.

Presentation : [click here](https://github.com/haejiyun/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Sales%20Country%20Clustering/market%20study.pdf)<br/>
Country group analysis by clustering. Country groups were made based on information collected from datasets of population and food availability from FAO. Two methods of clustering are used and visualised to compare the results.
<br/>

- **[Machine Learning] Fake Bill Detection**<br/>
Code : [click here](https://github.com/haejiyun/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Fake%20Bill%20Detection/detection_faux_billet.ipynb)<br/>
Presentation : [click here](https://github.com/haejiyun/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Fake%20Bill%20Detection/detection_faux_billet.pdf)<br/>
Modelling automatic fake bill detection. Le dataset containing geometric information of 1,500 bills is used for modelling. Two algorithms are tested to select the best performing one.
