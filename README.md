# Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository showcases a collection of my academic machine learning projects. The projects cover a range of techniques, from sentiment analysis using natural language processing to supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms for classification and clustering tasks. Each project demonstrates my ability to apply appropriate machine learning methods to real-world problems and communicate the insights through interactive applications and presentations.

## [Python] Prediction of Socio-Economic Classes

**Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM<br/>
**Techniques**: Cross-Validation, ROC, AUC<br/>
**Metrics**: Accuracy, F1 Score, Contingency Table, Confusion Matrix<br/>
**Challenges**: Unknown Classes, Imbalanced Data<br/>

Socio-economics is a multifaceted concept that encompasses factors such as income, profession, education, and more, within a society. Although there are no universal socio-economic classifications, distinguishing between socio-economic classes is necessary for various purposes.

In this project, we aim to classify 99,989 individuals in France into two distinct classes, which remain undisclosed for confidentiality purposes. The classification process relies solely on data, ensuring that it is free from any preconceived biases or assumptions regarding the classes. A significant challenge is the imbalanced nature of the classes. The input data includes socio-economic variables such as education level, household type, age, gender, and city of residence.

Classical classification algorithms are fine-tuned to achieve a target precision of 90%.<br/>

## [Python] Clustering of French Cities and Rupture Detection of Voting Behavior

**Algorithms**: PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, K-means, PELT<br/>

“Une histoire du conflit” by Thomas Piketty and Julia Cagé explores the evolution of electoral social structures in France. The book serves as a valuable source of socio-economic data over time.

In our project, we utilize data such as voting preferences, average income, average age, educational attainment, home ownership rates, and population to analyze the characteristics of different clusters of areas in France in relation to voting behavior. Furthermore, we identify points where significant changes in voting behavior occur.

As this study employs unsupervised learning techniques, much of the analysis is graphical and visual, allowing us to uncover meaningful insights from the data.

We employ various techniques for dimensionality reduction, clustering, and rupture detection.

## [Python] Country Selection for Chicken Export by Clustering

**Algorithms**: PCA, K-means, Hierarchical Clustering<br/>

When expanding into new markets, selecting the right target countries is crucial for successful and strategic market expansion. This project focuses on identifying optimal countries for chicken exports on a global scale. To achieve this, we conducted an analysis using data related to country fact sheets and food availability provided by the FAO.

Extensive data cleaning and preprocessing were performed, followed by preliminary data exploration. These steps were essential to apply various clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques effectively.
